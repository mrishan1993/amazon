2025-06-29,B0F7C1HW2G,Chamak Tyre,N/A,2 ratings,#123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve tried a few dashboard polishes before, but Chamak really lives up to its name! The moment I used it on my Honda City’s dashboard, the dullness was gone and it brought back a rich, natural shine without making it greasy or slippery. It smells clean, not too strong, and dries fast, which I loved.The best part? After a week of daily driving in Delhi dust and heat, my dashboard still looks clean and doesn’t attract as much dust as it used to. I’ve even used it on my door trims and steering — works just as well on plastic and vinyl. I plan to try it on my bike's side panels too.Another bonus is the UV protection and anti-crack formula. In Indian summers, dashboards get ruined fast, but I can already tell this will help keep it looking new.Highly recommended — especially if you like keeping your car’s interior looking premium without spending a lot at detailing shops!"
